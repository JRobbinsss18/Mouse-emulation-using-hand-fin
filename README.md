# Hand mouse controls
## Uses webcam mic & various libraries such as mediapipe to create basic mouse controls for your PC.
## Has basic controls, primarily designed for slideshows and such
- Mouse is the tip of your index, so for best use, make a fist with your middle ring and pinky so it can't confuse your index with any other finger, even though in most cases it wont.
- Tapping or holding your index & thumb emulates left mouse click (selection).
- Making a fist on the left side of the screen emulates left arrow click (built for slideshow presentations primarily)
- Making a fist on the right side of the screen emulates left arrow click (built for slideshow presentations primarily)

For the left/right features, timing of when left/right registers changes based on framerate of your webcam, holding the pose will press it multiple times. getting the timing right to only press left/right once is fairly easy once you test it out.
